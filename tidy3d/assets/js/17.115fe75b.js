When a beam of light is incident upon a diffractive grating, the light is diffracted into multiple directions, creating a characteristic pattern of bright and dark regions. These gratings have found applications in a wide range of fields, including telecommunications, spectroscopy, and imaging. Unlike traditional reflective or refractive optics, diffractive gratings rely on interference effects to shape and direct light, offering unique advantages such as high efficiency, compact size, and ease of fabrication.
