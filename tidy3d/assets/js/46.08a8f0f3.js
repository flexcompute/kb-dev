The Courant factor can be determined by the formula: C = c * Δt / Δx. To ensure the stability of the numerical solution, the Courant factor must be equal to or less than 1, according to the CFL condition: C ≤ 1.

In practice, this small difference rarely matters, but is important to understand for simulations that require high accuracy. There are two possible sources for the reflection from absorbers. The first, and more common one, is that the ramping up of the conductivity is not sufficiently slow, which can be remedied by increasing the number of absorber layers (40 by default). The second one is that the absorption is not high enough, such that the light reaches the PEC boundary at the end of the Absorber, travels back through it, and is still not fully attenuated before re-entering the simulation region.
