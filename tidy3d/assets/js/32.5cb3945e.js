Metalenses are capable of achieving high resolution imaging, can be easily integrated with other optical components, and have the potential to significantly reduce the size and weight of traditional lens systems. Additionally, metalenses can be designed to operate across a wide range of wavelengths, making them useful in a variety of applications, such as in imaging, sensing, and communications.
