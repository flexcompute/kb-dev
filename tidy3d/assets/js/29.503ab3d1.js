They consist of a periodic structure of ridges or grooves etched into a thin film on a substrate, which diffracts light at a specific angle and wavelength. Grating couplers offer advantages over other coupling techniques, such as low loss, high efficiency, and the ability to integrate with other photonic components on a chip. They are widely used in applications such as optical communications, sensing, and biomedical imaging. The design and optimization of grating couplers are important areas of research in the field of integrated photonics.
