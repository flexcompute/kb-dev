The FSS can be designed to selectively filter and manipulate the electromagnetic waves that pass through it based on the geometry, spacing, and material properties of its constituent elements.

Due to its very thin copper layer (0.1 mm) compared to the wavelength (~2.5 cm), we model the copper layer as a 2D surface conductivity to ensure computational efficiency.
