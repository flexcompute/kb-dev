When the thickness of each layer is close to a quarter of the medium wavelength, nearly perfect reflection occurs due to constructive interference of the reflected waves at each layer. DBR is commonly used at optical and UV wavelengths due to the fact that metallic reflectors have a high loss at high frequencies.
