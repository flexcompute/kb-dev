It consists of a circular waveguide in which light is confined and guided along the circumference of the ring, with the help of a waveguide coupler or a directional coupler that allows light to enter and exit the ring. The light circulating inside the ring resonator undergoes constructive or destructive interference, depending on the wavelength of the light, resulting in a resonant condition at certain frequencies. This allows the ring resonator to act as a narrowband filter or a wavelength-selective element, which can be used to transmit, reflect, or drop specific wavelengths of light. Ring resonators are widely used in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to their compact size, high efficiency, and low power consumption.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("This is a simple example of using Tidy3D to perform a 2D simulation of a ring resonator side coupled to a dielectric waveguide.
